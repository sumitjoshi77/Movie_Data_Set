# Movie_Data_Set

I am working on a machine learning project to predict IMDb scores using movie metadata. I have cleaned and preprocessed the data, and identified some important features that may be correlated with IMDb scores. I have trained and evaluated two machine learning models: linear regression and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Both models are performing well on the training data, with accuracy scores above 0.70. However, the KNN model appears to be performing better on the test data, with an accuracy score of 0.74.

Overall, I am happy with the progress of my project. I am planning to improve the performance of my models in the future by trying different machine learning algorithms, tuning the hyperparameters of my models, and using a larger dataset.
